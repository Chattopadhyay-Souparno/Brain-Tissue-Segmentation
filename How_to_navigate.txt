This folder contains the implementation of Brain Tissue Segmentation of the IBSR dataset. 

The architecture included in the report can be accessed using the notebooks:

1. 2DDenseUnet.ipynb
2. Ensemble.ipynb (Final Submission)

The results (test) are saved inside Segmented_outputs/Test_Set/ 
For clarity I am also including the Segmentations performed using the Ensemble on the Validation dataset along with their ground_truths located at
Segmented_outputs/Validation_Set/segmented_outputs/ and /ground_truths/ respectively

The validation ground truth labels are of dimensions 256X128X256 with a voxel spacing of 1x1.5x1 .
So the segmentation map of the test data are also saved along the same dimensions. 

The checking of this segmentation can be properly done using the Ensemble Evaluation and Checking Proper Segmentation part of the Ensemble.ipynb
The functions to calculate the Dice , HD and VD has also been implemented in these sections to avoid any discrepancies. 


A very detailed implementation report can be found in the folder Report
